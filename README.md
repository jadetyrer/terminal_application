## Software Development Plan 

### Statement of purpose and scope

This application will allow the user to book a manicure or pedcicure selecting the details of the treatment. The application will ask te user the details of the treatment and store the user input in a hash. The program will allow the user to randomise or customise thier treatment. This gives the option to select the exact style they would like (colours, shape and nail art) or will randomly pick from the list of options to produce a unique style. The user will then be asked if they are happy with the outcome of the randomised option. If the response is no the application will then produce another randomised style until the user is happy with the outcome.
