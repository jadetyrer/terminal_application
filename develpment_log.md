### Development log 

<b>Thursday 14th November</b>

As planned I continued to develop my code by putting certain elements into methods. During the creation of my methods I realised it would be easier if I produced the final printed order in a class. This way I could ensure all parameters are met to print the final result. Creating the order class also allowed me to print only the parameters I needed based on the user input. 

I also added a feature that reads the nail shape and nail art options from a text file and then prints to the terminal. This way the user does not have to have prior coding knowledge in order to change these menu options in the future they can amended from the text file.

There are still a few errors with my code that I need to address, the randomise feature of my program is not displaying the results that the user has selected they are happy with. This is the next part of my code that I will work on. 

I have decided if I have time to add in another feature to the application that take the customer name and email as inputs and writes this to the file at the end along side the order details. This will increase the capabilities of the program.

I have successfully completed both the customize and randomise features of my application and have created a new class to create an instance for each customer order. I am then planning to write both the customer details and the details of their order to a file to view the order at a later date. Due to time constraints I have decided only to add the name and email as customer details. Adding the phone number will require additional validation which will take quite a while to implement. 

I have also written a test for my code that ensures that each of my randomisation outputs are not the the same. The test takes two instances of the randomised orders and compares them to ensure they are not equal.

I have added a command line argument that will further personalise the application to the salon using the program.
